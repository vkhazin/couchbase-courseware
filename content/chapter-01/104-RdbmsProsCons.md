# Rdbms strengths and shortcomings #


## Strengths ##
* Simple data structure - tables
* Limit redundancy or duplication of data
* Data inconsistencies are avoided
* Vendor independent logical data modeling
* Relatively 'standard' ad-hoc queries support using Sql
* Rich Etl and Reporting tools ecosystem

## Weaknesses
* Difficult to represent hierarchies of data and recursive queries
* Limited support for complex data types and with a limited computation syntax
* Designed to run on a single server to maintain integrity of the data
* Scalability and elasticity is a huge challenge for relational databases
* Latest architectural changes only hide the underlying problem
