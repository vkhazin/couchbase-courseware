* Cross data centers replication
* Big Data and Streaming support
* Flexibility and freedom to choose: type and vendor

## Weaknesses
* Data duplication is common
* Limited portability between NoSql vendors
* No joins, foreign keys, unions, or joins
* Limited ACID support, ACID 2.0 has been introduced
