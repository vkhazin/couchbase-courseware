# Rdbms strengths and shortcomings #

## Shortcomings ##
* Difficult to represent hierarchies of data and recursive queries
* Limited support for complex data types and with a limited computation syntax
* Designed to run on a single server to maintain integrity of the data
* Scalability and elasticity is a huge challenge for relational databases
* Latest architectural changes only hide the underlying problem
