# Why NoSql Databases #

* History, hype, and industry trends
* Rdbms strengths and shortcomings - strong consistency, rich ecosystem, weak scalability and limited availability options
* NoSql strength and weaknesses - replication and sharding built-in, high scalability and availability, limited ecosystem, eventually consistency
* CAP theorem - pick two out of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
* Search Engines, Big Data, and Data Streaming - where Rdbms used to answer all needs, NoSql has taken a different approach, for now
* Polyglot persistency - no more one size fits all, for different needs - different tools
* Cloud and NoSql consideration - a different view on Rdbms, NoSql support is strong and growing
