# History of Databases Cont'd#

* 1990's Object-Oriented - combine database capabilities with OOP language capabilities
    * Data has been seen as objects and their attributes rather than rows and columns
    * Provided an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) as alternative to purely relational SQL.
    * The early commercial products were integrated with various languages e.g. GemStone - Smalltalk
    * An attempt at standardization of querying language - Object Query Language (OQL).
    * Examples: Gemstone , Gbase, ITASCA, TORNADO, and etc.
* 2000's NoSql - New Sql, Not just Sql, non relational - answer to demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance.
	* Triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com
	* Motivated by simplicity of design, simpler and massive "horizontal" scaling to clusters of machines and finer control over availability
	* Many compromise consistency in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed
	* Examples: MongoDb, Cassandra, CouchDB, Couchbase, Neo4J, and many more
