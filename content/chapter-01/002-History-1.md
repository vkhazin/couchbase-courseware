# History of Databases #

* 1960's Navigational - records are found primarily by following references from other records
    * From the era of magnetic tapes with sequential access
    * Navigational references allowed to locate next record on the tape
    * Later systems added B-trees to provide alternate access paths
    * Examples: IBM Information Management System, CODASYL - Conference/Committee on Data Systems Languages
* 1970's Relational databases - entities referencing other entities plus addition of "search" capabilities
	* Present data in tabular form, i.e. as a collection of tables with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns
	* Provided relational operators to manipulate the data in tabular form
	* Later ACID-compliant transaction processing with strong database consistency characteristics and high level of database security were introduced
