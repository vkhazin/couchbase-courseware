# Chapter Three - Data Modeling with NoSql #

* Group Exercise: use customer data and ask to map without fk/joins supported
* Linking - similar to Rdbms joins, familiar to data modelers, no or little query language support
* Upside down approach - model the data usage not the data storage
* De-normalization and Aggregation - duplicates and pre-processed data is Okay if not Great
* Application side joins - when reads and writes are fast, data access patterns change
* Search engines do searches better, keyword searches is likely a requirement
* Group exercise: key strategy for key/value and document NoSql
