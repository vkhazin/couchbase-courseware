* Views and Indexes support querying data by different means
* MapReduce View executes function to incrementally process every mutation on the buckets to calculate view
* Spatial View executes a geographic aware function to allow multidimensional bounding box queries
* Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) index document attributes  to provide a faster lookup with N1QL queries
