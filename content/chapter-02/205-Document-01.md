# Document Databases #

* Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information and semi-structured data
* Xml and Json databases are main categories of NoSql databases, data is stored as xml/json:
~~~
	{
	    "FirstName": "Bob",

* Document-oriented databases are a subclass of key-value stores
* The main difference from key-value - the data is processed for querying and aggregation purposes
* Lotus Domino with first release in 1989 is arguably the first document database
* CouchDB (Couch is an acronym for cluster of unreliable commodity hardware) created in 2005 by former Lotus Notes developer at IBM.
