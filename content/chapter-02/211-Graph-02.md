## Comparison to Rdbms ##
* Relationships are first-class citizens of the graph data model
* Graph databases are like the next generation of relational databases
* Each node directly and physically contains a list of relationship-records
* Data models are much simpler and more expressive than those of Rdbms or other NoSQL databases
