# Key-Value Databases - cont'd #

* May implement different consistency models: eventual consistency, versions, transaction consistency
* Redis and Apache Cassandra - eventually consistent
* Couchbase - strongly consist when accessing object by key within a cluster
* In-memory only vs. disk persistence
* Memcached and Oracle Coherence - memcached does not replicate, Coherence does
* Redis and Riak - persist to disk, not always as reliably as Rdbms
