# Why NoSql Databases #


* History, hype, and industry trends
* Rdbms strengths and shortcomings - strong consistency, rich ecosystem, weak scalability and limited availability options
*  NoSql strength and weaknesses - replication and sharding built-in, high scalability and availability, limited ecosystem, eventually consistency
*  CAP theorem - pick two out of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
*  Search Engines, Big Data, and Data Streaming - where Rdbms used to answer all needs, NoSql takes a different approach for now
*  Polyglot persistency - no more one size fits all, for different needs - different tools
* Cloud and NoSql consideration - a different view on Rdbms, NoSql support is strong and growing

# History of Databases #

* 1960's Navigational - records are found primarily by following references from other records
    * From the era of magnetic tapes with sequential access
    * Navigational references allowed to locate next record on the tape
    * Later systems added B-trees to provide alternate access paths
    * Examples: IBM Information Management System, CODASYL - Conference/Committee on Data Systems Languages
* 1970's Relational databases - entities referencing other entities plus addition of "search" capabilities
	* Present data in tabular form, i.e. as a collection of tables with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns
	* Provided relational operators to manipulate the data in tabular form
