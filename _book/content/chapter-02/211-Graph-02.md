## Comparison to Rdbms ##
* Relationships are first-class citizens of the graph data model
* Graph databases are like the next generation of relational databases
* Each node directly and physically contains a list of relationship-records
* Data models are much simpler and more expressive than those of Rdbms or other NoSQL databases
* Pre-history of graph databases: mid-1960's IBM's IMS supported tree like structures
* <a href="http://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms" target="_blank">21 listed as of Sep-2016, Neo4j is in the lead</a>
* Good fit for: network/infrastructure management, identity/access management, recommendation engine, social networks
