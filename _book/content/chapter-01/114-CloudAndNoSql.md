# Cloud and NoSql #

* Private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, and fog computing
* Data needs to be available in multiple geo locations - locally
* Cloud based Rdbms - close to classic Rdbms but not the same
* Azure Sql - lots of guidance and restrictions to be aware of
* Oracle Cloud Database - restrictions and guidance as well
* Aws Aurora - MySql compatible, not identical
* Aws, Azure, Google, Oracle - offer NoSql database technologies for a reason
* Lot's of DbaaS (database as a service) independent vendors, Sql and NoSql alike
